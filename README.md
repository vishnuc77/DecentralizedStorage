Decentralized File Storage

This is a dapp using which a user can store any file in a decentralized manner with the help of IPFS. Once the file is uploaded to IPFS, a hash will be returned which can be used to view that file.

Used solidity, web3.js, truffle framework and react.js to develop the application and it was deployed to Rinkeby test network.
